A simple python ai bot created with the sole purpose to play "Sushi-Go-Round". Based off of: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117.

I am using this to familarize myself with the tools integrated in Anaconda. From here, I hope to create more advanced bots

Can be opened and run with any python editor
